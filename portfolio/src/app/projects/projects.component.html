        <p>This Project was done to learn html and css with flex boxes as well as flex grid.</p>

        <p>My Daily Planner was our first project where a real programming language was introduced</p>
        <p>I programmed this page with JavaScript so that the user of the page is able to <br> change the priority of each task and put the task on done or delete.</p>

        <p>In the last CodeReview i did for the Frontend, the task was to make a page for a Pizzeria.</p>
        <p>For this we used Angular and made it so that the user can add different items of the <br> Pizzeria to his shopping cart. I also programmed some special events into this <br> so that the user gets a discount for his order when his order is more than 40â‚¬.</p>

        <br><br>
        <p>After our last project we made a group project about for a Photographer.</p>
        <p>We made this project in Angular and tried to make it seem like a real Photographer's page. <br>We also got some pictures from a real Photographer.</p>
